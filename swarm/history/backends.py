"""Abstract interface for conversation-history storage backends.

This indirection allows us to swap the concrete implementation (in-memory,
Redis, etc.) without touching call-sites.  All operations are asynchronous so
IO-bound backends (e.g. Redis) don’t block the event-loop even when an
in-memory implementation is used.
