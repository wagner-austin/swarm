"""Utility helpers for running blocking callables in a thread pool.

This module provides a thin wrapper around ``asyncio.loop.run_in_executor``
so that synchronous / CPU-heavy functions can be executed without blocking the
asyncio event-loop.  Using the **default** executor is sufficient for most
Discord frontend workloads – if you need fine-grained control (e.g. a dedicated)
``ThreadPoolExecutor``), extend this helper or call the low-level API directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coro_factory:
        Zero-arg callable returning an awaitable.  A *new* coroutine/awaitable **must** be
        created on each call – so pass a *factory*, not the coroutine itself.
    max_tries:
        Total attempts (initial call counts as 1).
    initial_delay:
        Delay **before** the first retry attempt (in seconds).
    backoff:
        Multiplier applied to the delay after each failed attempt.  Defaults to *2.0*.

    Returns
    -------
    The awaited result of *coro_factory* on the first successful attempt.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Re-raises the *last* encountered exception if all attempts fail.
